There are issues labelled that would be easy to contribute to for beginners.
#### Bug reports
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.

#### Pull Requests
The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain code quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions
Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
- Follow all instructions in the template
- After you submit your pull request, verify that it works for all possibilities
- If the code is failing please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is happening or when it happens. If it concluded that the failure was a false positive, then an issue will be opened to track that problem.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
